here's is short guide on how app should work

New user!!
- register
if successful, redirect to home screen ... since user is new and has no historical data, app will show recommended restaurants based on location (user must allow location access)

- after user has used the app for a while, app will show recommended restaurants based on user's history

- okay..user sees restuarants nearby, selects prefered, selects items needed and a number (for example burger x2, fries x1, etc.)
- user can also add custom items to the order.. like remove tomatoes, add extra cheese, etc.
user can also add notes to the order

- okay.. now user Adds to Cart..

user can then proceed to checkout by first checking if cart is correct, where user can select payment method, delivery address (autosave these for next time user logs in), etc.


- user confirms and payment is successful, they see a modal with something like "order placed successfully, keep that stomach hungry coz yummyness is coming (somthing along those lines)"... user can either go to home or track order

- if any order is active, Orders screen need to flash or show a notification that its active.

once user receives order, they can rate the order and leave a review, and even favourite the restaurant if they want 

- more often visited restaurants should be shown at the top of the list at home screen under "Visit Again!"


-


For users who already have an account

- they can login with email and password
- if successful, redirect to home screen
- if not successful, show error message
- if user forgets password, they can reset it


- often visited restaurants should be shown at the top of the list at home screen under "Visit Again!"

---

user can click on the card on Catergories, to show menus and restuarants serving that type of food. for example, if user clicks on Beverages, it should show all beverages available from all restaurants, along with their details, and price and how far the restuarant is from their current location.



-- not registered or logged in?/
- no problem, user can still browse the menue from resturants but cannot place an order




IMAGES

Create a new Git repository, add your
  images to a dedicated folder (e.g., images/), then commit and push.
  3) Deploy this repository as a Static Site on Render.com,
  configuring the root and publish directories appropriately. 4
  Obtain the direct public URL for each image from your deployed
  Render site (e.g., https://your-site-name.onrender.com/burger.jpg).
  5) Finally, update the imageUrl field in each Firestore FoodItem
  document with these Render URLs.

  Once you have compiled a mapping of your FoodItem.id to its
  corresponding Render.com image URL (e.g., {"main1":
  "https://my-eatery-images.onrender.com/grilled-chicken.jpg"}), I
  can generate a Firebase Admin SDK script to automate the Firestore
  imageUrl updates. Let me know when you're ready with this mapping.
